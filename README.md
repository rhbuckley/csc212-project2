## CSC212 Project II

## Summary

This is the capstone project for the Data Structure's & Algorithm's class at the University of Rhode Island. This is not our original submission, the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mboekamp03/CSC_212_Final_Project). The reason for this duplicate repository is this will be highly annotated to explain the reasoning behind our decisions throughout the project.

For the sake of transparency I (@rhbuckley) was responsible for the following items (if you are here to look at my code, I don't want to lead you the wrong way).

-   Everything in `./timing`
-   Radix Sort (see `./sorts.cpp`)
-   Google Slides Presentation

Though the skills demonstrated in this project do not show much detail in OOP, plenty of OOP principles can be seen within my [react-sort repository](https://github.com/rhbuckley/react-sort), which also features a working page.

If you are still intererested in this project, I would also reccomend looking through the `CSC 212 Report Presentation.pdf`, as it definitely helps get a high level overview of this project.

## Planning

We met multiple times over the weeks to discuss who would handle what algorithm, how we would share it visually and how to find the time complexity of each algorithm. Once we were able to use a visualizer we moved on to the presentation. This presentation will come to include graphs, comparisons and the logic behind the code. Once everything is set for our presentation and research we met again to record ourselves to see how efficiently we can discuss our findings. We would then divide up the report into pieces for us to begin and work together to fill any gaps for the report.
